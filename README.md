<h1 align="left">Hi 👋, I'm Audi Previo</h1>
<p align="left">I'm a full stack software engineer with a front-end focus and extensive experience in UX research and design. Skilled in developing and maintaining map-based applications, particularly using LeafletJS and Google Maps API. Oh, and I have also dabbled and developed a couple of AI/LLM/Image Generation Apps.

I'm experienced in agile product-tech environments, adept at utilizing front-end frameworks like Next.JS and Tailwind CSS and has proven ability to integrate these with back-end technologies such as Express.JS and MongoDB, as well as various CMS platforms.

Tl;dr about me: 
- 🌱 I’m currently working fulltime at Bumiterra developing: (1) Sustainable E-commerce site using Shopify, (2) Reforestation Registry, && (3) Map-based Apps (Biodiversity Map) 

- 🔭 Outside of the office I like to explore interesting projects around Map-based app && AI Web App development. One of my previous AI-web app is Undernet Chat, a video game-based GPT-based Chat bot with >10.000 API hits & >4.000.000 tokens in around 3 months after its launch.

- 👨‍💻 All of my projects are available in this Github as well as at <a href="audiprevio.dev">audiprevio.dev</a>

- 💬 Feel free to ask me about **Next.JS, AI, Sustainability, and the meaning of life**


Let's connect and make an awesome project or two! 😁
